		w5: "Do you see that thing at the end of this zone? It's huge! It's terrifying! You've never seen anything like it before, but you know that it is a Blimp. How did you know that? Stop knowing things and go kill it.",
		w6: "You step over the corpse of the Blimp as it rapidly deflates, and one of your Trimps chuckles at the sound produced. You all cross the sulfuric river to the next zone, and can feel the presence of an ancient knowledge. Better explore.",
		w7: "Slow and steady wins the race. Unless you're racing someone who is actually trying.",
		w8: "Your settlement is getting crowded, there's Trimps in the streets and you're taking heat. You feel a sudden strong desire to create a map, though you're not quite sure how that would help.",
		w9: "You can't shake the feeling that you've been here before. Deja Vu?",
		w10: "Looks like another Blimp up ahead. Hard to tell from far away, but it looks like it has more heads than the last one.",
		w11: "You're unstoppable as long as nothing stops you. Unfortunately, it seems like something really wants to stop you.",
		w12: "Did you see that green light flash by? Weird. Oh well.",
		w13: "Your scientists have finally concluded their report on the analysis of the size of the world. According to the report, they're pretty sure it's infinitely large, but you're pretty sure they just got bored of checking.",
		w14: "You were trying to help bring back some of the Equipment your Trimps left on the ground in that last zone, and you got a splinter. This planet is getting dangerous, stay alert.",		
		w15: "Another day, another Blimp at the end of the zone",
		w16: "Seriously? Another Blimp so soon?",
		w17: "You climb a large cliff and look out over the new zone. Red dirt, scorched ground, and devastation. Is that a Dragimp flying around out there?!",
		w18: "There seems to be a strange force urging you to keep going. The atmosphere is becoming... angrier. Part of you wants to turn around and go back, but most of you wants to keep going.",
		w19: "You look behind and see your kingdom. You have gems, a colony, and territory. You wonder if enough Trimps have already fallen in battle. After contemplation, one word falls out of your mouth as you begin to move forward. 'Nah'",
		w20: "You can sense that you're close to your goal.",
		w22: "Strange, the sky seems to be getting darker. You ask one of your Trimps for the time, but he doesn't know what a clock is.",
		w25: "You're a rebel. The universe pointed you into that portal, but you kept pushing forward. You feel... less like you've been here before.",
		w27: "It seems like the further you press on, the less you know. You still feel an urge to use the portal, though the urge has begun to dwindle.",
		w29: "Your Trimps came up with a pretty catchy battle song that got stuck in your head. None of them survived the next fight though, and you can't remember most of it. Life's tough.",
		w33: "You climb over a large hill that was separating this zone from the last. The sky is pitch black and lightning crackles in the distance. This is a site of heavy corruption.",
		w35: "You start to wonder how long you've been doing the same thing over and over. There must be something you can do to start to break the cycle. Perhaps you could alter the portal...",
		w40: "You can't help but notice that the Trimps seem to be the only creatures on this planet not immediately hostile towards outsiders. You ask a nearby Trimp soldier what he thinks you are, and he drools a bit.",
		w42: "The world seems so barren out this far. You feel like you're finally starting to get ahead of the curve, but you know by now not to get comfortable.",
		w44: "Each day and night seems to grow longer than the one before. Is time slowing down? Argh! You fall to your knees with a splitting headache and a strong desire to use the portal. After a few minutes, it passes and you forget what happened. What are we talking about?",
		w46: "All traces of hills and mountains have long since been trudged past. The world is flat and hostile. You wish your Trimps were better conversationalists.",
		w48: "As your Trimps scavenge every last bit of helium from that Blimp, one of them begins freaking out. He runs around waving his little arms and making funny noises for a while, eats some dirt, then takes a little nap. You wonder if that's normal. Yeah... probably fine.",
		w50: "It's been a long time since you've found any blueprints in the maps. You start to wonder where those things even come from.",
		w51: "Your scientists have detected an anomaly at the end of Zone 59. They recommend that you stop doing whatever it is that you're doing.",
		w53: "As you get closer to the anomaly, you start to notice more and more strange behaviour from your Trimps. Holes in your memory are starting to become noticeable as multiple existences blend in to one. Trippy.",
		w54: "As you get closer to the anomaly, you start to notice more and more strange behaviour from your Trimps. Holes in your memory are starting to become noticeable as multiple existences blend in to one. Trippy.",
		w56: "A loud boom echoes in the distance, and one of your Trimps runs up to you with outstretched arms, looking quite frightened. He probably just wants some armor and weapons! You hand him some gear and send him on his way.",
		w58: "A huge storm has formed and daylight has become a luxury you have mostly forgotten about. Your Trimps seem to want to go back home, but you're pretty sure you're supposed to keep going this way, so you do. You're very close to the anomaly.",
		w59: "There it is. The anomaly is at the end of the zone. You can see it but you don't know what you're seeing. Where did that... thing... come from?! This is highly Improbable.",
		w60: "The ground instantly cracks and large plumes of green gas escape from the planet's core to the atmosphere. The planet feels different. Everything feels different. This Universe has grown unstable, the planet has broken. What have you done?",
		w61: "Other than all the dead Trimps, that wasn't so bad.",
		w65: "You feel more powerful than ever. The universe seems to be constantly adjusting itself to get rid of you, yet you rise against and persist. Something as tiny as you taking on an entire universe!",
		w68: "You figure some entertainment wouldn't be awful, and decide to teach your Trimps how to play soccer. A few hours and zero progress later, you really regret that decision.",
		w70: "The Improbabilities haven't seemed to slow down. You know you need to figure out a plan, but you don't know what to plan for.",
